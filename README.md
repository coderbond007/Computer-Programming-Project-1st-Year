# Computer-Programming-Project-1st-Year
This project was made by the joint efforts of Pradyumn Agrawal(myself) and Susmit Lavania which taught us how to convert sorting algorithms into code, output large data using bash script and generate GNU Plot. And then finally present the results in form of report and presentation using LaTeX.
